The Keep Note Application is a note-taking app designed to allow users to:

  - Take Notes: Create and manage notes on various topics.
  - Add Notes to Labels/Categories: Organize notes into different categories or labels for easier navigation and filtering.
  - Set Reminders for a Note: Assign reminders to notes, helping users keep track of important tasks and deadlines.

This application is developed as part of the "Implement Polyglot Persistence Using SQL and NoSQL Databases" course, with the objective of demonstrating all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations across SQL database.

Additionally, I created a Docker image and made a container for the application, exploring Docker configuration to facilitate seamless deployment and management of the application in various environments.
